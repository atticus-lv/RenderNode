RenderStackNode is an addon that provide users with node based, flexible rendering output workflow. <br>
It can be also use in look-dev or design.<br>

## What can RSN do

> [!NOTE]
> **The core of RSN is to modify the data in the scene before rendering, which makes it more flexible** <br>

+ Render **multiple shots** in the scene, and take the name of the camera as the name of the output image   [ðŸ‘‰Link](Example1.md)
+ In each shot, objects' **placement, material and data** can be different   [ðŸ‘‰Link](Example2.md)
+ Add **animation** to one of the shots, and render with another rendering engine (such as workbench)
+ If you are not sure how long a shot will be rendered, you can send a report email to the specified email after
  rendering
+ Just press the button, you can **queue render** all the above needed shots without waiting in front of the computer

> [!NOTE]
> **RSN takes the node settings, and use it to overwrite the scene**

1. There are some settings node in the scene:

    + **Camera Node** have the ability to change the camera
    + **File path Node** give an format name of the render files
    + **Eevee Setting Node** means that in this task you will render with the eevee engine

2. **Task Node** to merge your changes into one render task (so it can be use to render)

3. **Viewer Node**  apply and view the changes

4. **Render List Node**  render all the task that you need

*Once you plug a node settings to overide something into the a task,the next task will inherit it if there is not a same
type Node plug input. <br>So you may start a new render list to keep your node tree cleaner*
